# Contributing

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to the universal-router-ts! ðŸŽ‰

PRs are the preferred way to spike ideas and address issues, if you have time. If you plan on contributing frequently, please feel free to ask to become a maintainer; the more the merrier. ðŸ¤™

## Technical overview

This library uses following libraries for development:

- [typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) for typed JavaScript and transpilation
- [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing
  - run `yarn test:watch` during development
- [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) for creating UMD bundles
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) for package management
- [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) for executing tasks

### ðŸ§ª Tests

Test are written and run via Jest ðŸ’ª

```sh
# Run whole test suite once
yarn test
# Run test in watch mode
yarn test:watch
# Ged code coverage
yarn test:coverage
```

### ðŸ’… Style guides

Style guides are enforced by robots _(I meant prettier and tslint of course ðŸ¤– )_, so they'll let you know if you screwed something, but most of the time, they'll autofix things for you. Magic right ?

Lint and format codebase via npm-script:

```sh
#Format and fix lint errors
yarn ts:style:fix
```

#### Commit conventions (via commitizen)

- this is preferred way how to create conventional-changelog valid commits
- if you prefer your custom tool we provide a commit hook linter which will error out, it you provide invalid commit message
- if you are in rush and just wanna skip commit message validation just prefix your message with `WIP: something done` ( if you do this please squash your work when you're done with proper commit message so standard-version can create Changelog and bump version of your library appropriately )

```sh
# invoke [commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
yarn commit
```

### ðŸ“– Documentation

```sh
yarn docs
```

#### Setup

1.  Fork the repo.
1.  `git clone` your fork.
1.  Make a `git checkout -b branch-name` branch for your change.
1.  Run `yarn install --ignore-scripts` (make sure you have node and yarn installed first)
    Updates

1.  Make sure to add unit tests
1.  If there is a `*.spec.ts` file, update it to include a test for your change, if needed. If this file doesn't exist, please create it.
1.  Run `yarn test` or `yarn test:watch` to make sure all tests are working, regardless if a test was added.
